# XChange -- A Ruby On Rails Project!

## Introduction

XChange is a mini stock exchange where people can trade stocks. Users can sign up with either an investor account, which can buy and sell all the listed stocks, or a broker account, which can list stocks on the exchange to trade. 

## Usage

After cloning the repo, run bundle to install dependencies. To migrate your local database, run rake db:migrate. To start the application on your machine, run 'rails s' from the application root. In a browser, go to http://localhost:3000/ to begin.

## Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/pipivybin/XChange. This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to the Contributor Covenant code of conduct.
